Tune: There is a Tavern in the Town

‘Twas in the year of nineteen-one,
nineteen one,
That Ferry Beach was first begun, first begun,
When Quillen Shinn and his fourteen pioneers
Insured their vision for the years.
First they bought the grove for preaching,
Then they saw the need for teaching,
And achieved a brilliant conquest over
Doubts and fears.
CHORUS:
Oh Shinn, O dear old Quillen Shinn,
Quillen Shhinn!
To you we raise this grateful din, grateful din!
We well lift your name
To the highest green pine tree
And pledge, and pledge our loyalty.
In bygone days the Boston Maine,
Boston Maine,
Puffed near the shore with dummy train,
Dummy train,
And railroad men from far and roundabout
Did gather here to roust and shout.
But our fathers like fish chowder,
And our preachers shouted louder,
‘Til they drove the dummy
And the railroaders out! CHORUS
Oh, once we had a pavilion, pavilion,
And it was one in a million, a million,
And the darned old roof
Would always spring a leak
When brother Doe began to speak.

They were enterprising fellers
For the folks all brought umbrellers
And the sermon moved along
Without a single break! CHORUS
The Belmont was a bowling hall, bowling hall,
And echoed with the thundering ball,
Thundering ball.
For thus the blades of other happy days
Did roll the idle hours away.
Then we silenced all the roarers,
But we got instead our snorers,
You can her them in the grove
Or out in Saco Bay. CHORUS
There is no end to history, history,
But we will make no mystery, mystery,
That Rowland Hall and good old Underwood,
Show progress on the forward road.
So we beg you to remember
In the midst of next December
‘That we’ll come again next summer
Back to Ferry Beach. CHORUS`;

const ylml = `This Land is Your Land

Words and Music: Woody Guthrie

CHORUS:
This land is your land,
This land is my land,
From California, to the New York island.
From the redwood forest,
To the Gulf Stream waters,
This land was made for you and me.
As I went walking that ribbon of highway,
I saw above me that endless skyway;
I saw below me that golden valley;
This land was made for you and me.
CHORUS
I roamed and rambled,
And I followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts.
And all around me, a voice was sounding,
“This land was made for you and me.”
CHORUS
When the sun came shining,
Then I was strolling,
And the wheat fields waving,
And the dust clouds rolling,
A voice was chanting as the fog was lifting,
“This land was made for you and me.”`
