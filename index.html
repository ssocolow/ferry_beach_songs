        <pre style="display:none" id="qs">Quillen Shinn

Tune: There is a Tavern in the Town

‘Twas in the year of nineteen-one,
nineteen one,
That Ferry Beach was first begun, first begun,
When Quillen Shinn and his fourteen pioneers
Insured their vision for the years.
First they bought the grove for preaching,
Then they saw the need for teaching,
And achieved a brilliant conquest over
Doubts and fears.

CHORUS:
Oh Shinn, O dear old Quillen Shinn,
Quillen Shhinn!
To you we raise this grateful din, grateful din!
We well lift your name
To the highest green pine tree
And pledge, and pledge our loyalty.

In bygone days the Boston Maine,
Boston Maine,
Puffed near the shore with dummy train,
Dummy train,
And railroad men from far and roundabout
Did gather here to roust and shout.
But our fathers like fish chowder,
And our preachers shouted louder,
‘Til they drove the dummy
And the railroaders out!

CHORUS

Oh, once we had a pavilion, pavilion,
And it was one in a million, a million,
And the darned old roof
Would always spring a leak
When brother Doe began to speak.

They were enterprising fellers
For the folks all brought umbrellers
And the sermon moved along
Without a single break!

CHORUS

The Belmont was a bowling hall, bowling hall,
And echoed with the thundering ball,
Thundering ball.
For thus the blades of other happy days
Did roll the idle hours away.
Then we silenced all the roarers,
But we got instead our snorers,
You can hear them in the grove
Or out in Saco Bay.

CHORUS

There is no end to history, history,
But we will make no mystery, mystery,
That Rowland Hall and good old Underwood,
Show progress on the forward road.
So we beg you to remember
In the midst of next December
‘That we’ll come again next summer
Back to Ferry Beach.

<pre style="display:none" id="ylml">This Land is Your Land

Words and Music: Woody Guthrie

CHORUS:
This land is your land,
This land is my land,
From California, to the New York island.
From the redwood forest,
To the Gulf Stream waters,
This land was made for you and me.
As I went walking that ribbon of highway,
I saw above me that endless skyway;
I saw below me that golden valley;
This land was made for you and me.

CHORUS

I roamed and rambled,
And I followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts.
And all around me, a voice was sounding,
“This land was made for you and me.”

CHORUS

When the sun came shining,
Then I was strolling,
And the wheat fields waving,
And the dust clouds rolling,
A voice was chanting as the fog was lifting,
“This land was made for you and me.”</pre>


        <pre style="display:none" id="abnf">A Beach Named Ferry Beach
Words: John Packard, 1981

In Saco, Maine, there is a beach named Ferry,
With towering pines and lots of salt sea air.
There’s an old hotel
That looks out to the islands,
And lots of friendly folks to greet you there.

CHORUS

I love to listen to waves roll by,
And love –watching the seagulls fly,
And, friends, are gathering on the sand.
It takes me back to Ferry Beach again.
Some folks here they come to find religion,
And others come leave their care behind;
Some come for some peaceful introspection,
There’s many things a searcher here can find.

CHORUS

There’s a power in this place
That binds you to it.
Your spirit moves where ocean meets the land.
You get to keep what gifts
This place may give you,
Like a memory of a castle in the sand.

CHORUS</pre>

        <pre style="display:none" id="ed">
            Edelweiss
Words and Music:
Rodgers & Hammerstein

Edelweiss, Edelweiss,
Every morning you greet me.
Small and white, clean and bright,
You look happy to meet me.
Blossom of snow may you bloom and grow,
Bloom and grow forever.
Edelweiss, Edelweiss,
Bless my homeland forever.
(Sing twice.)

<pre style="display:none" id="ff">
Flying Free
Words and Music:  Don Besig

There is a place I call my own,
Where I can stand, by the sea,
And look beyond the things I’ve known,
And dream that I might be free.
Like the bird above the trees,
Gliding gently on the breeze.
I wish that all my life I’d be,
Without a care and flying free!

But life is not a distant sky,
Without a cloud, without rain.
And I can never hope that I
Can travel on without pain.
Time goes swiftly on its way.
All too soon we’ve lost today.
I cannot wait for skies of blue,
Or dream so long that life is through.

So life’s a song that I must sing,
A gift of love I must share.
And when I see the joy it brings,
My spirits soar through the air.
Like a bird up in the sky,
Life has taught me how to fly.
For now I know what I can be,
And now my heart is flying free.

Vive la Ferry Beach
Words:  The Kapp Family

Come closer, me hearties,

Vive la, vive la Ferry Beach,

With bay rum and foam,

A fabulous treasure is hid in the sand,
Vive la Ferry Beach!
‘Twas brought here of old from many a land,

And diamonds and gold,
